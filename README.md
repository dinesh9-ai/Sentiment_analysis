# Sentiment_analysis
This project is about determining whether given tweet is a positive tweet or negative tweet.
This project has two file tweet_classify.py and utils.py. Here in utils.py we have all the background functions(i.e frequency tables calculation..etc). In tweet_classify.py we have the G.U.I code and computing whether the tweet is positive or negative.
Here this sentiment analysis of tweets is based on modified Bayes theorem.
Here the feature extraction is done with frequency.
